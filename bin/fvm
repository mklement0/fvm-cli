# SYNOPSIS
#   quoteRe <text>
# DESCRIPTION
#   For *Sed*:
#   Quotes (escapes) the specified literal text for use in a regular expression
#   whether basic or extended - should work with all common flavors.
#   However, this function is NOT utility-agnostic - Perl has additional escaping requirements, for instance - cf. quotePerlRe()
#   Mutli-line strings are supported (actual newlines are converted to '\n'), but note that 
#   while `sed` does support `\n` to represent newlines in the regex, it'll only be able to match them
#   if you first read *multiple* lines into the pattern space.
#   To quote a *substitution string* in s/// calls, use quoteSubst().
# EXAMPLE
#   quoteRe $'Cost\(*):\n$3.'  # -> '[C][o][s][t][\][(][*][)][:]\n[$][3][.]'
quoteRe() { sed -e 's/[^^]/[&]/g; s/\^/\\^/g; $!a\'$'\n''\\n' <<<"$1" | tr -d '\n'; }

# MAN PAGE MARKDOWN SOURCE
#  - Place a Markdown-formatted version of the man page for this script
#    inside the here-document below.
#    The document must be formatted to look good in all 3 viewing scenarios:
#     - as a man page, after conversion to ROFF with marked-man
#     - as plain text (raw Markdown source)
#     - as HTML (rendered Markdown)
#  Markdown formatting tips:
#   - GENERAL
#     To support plain-text rendering in the terminal, limit all lines to 80 chars.,
#     and, for similar rendering as HTML, *end every line with 2 trailing spaces*.
#   - HEADINGS
#     - For better plain-text rendering, leave an empty line after a heading
#       marked-man will remove it from the ROFF version.
#     - The first heading must be a level-1 heading containing the utility
#       name and very brief description; append the manual-section number 
#       directly to the CLI name; e.g.:
#         # foo(1) - does bar
#     - The 2nd, level-2 heading must be '## SYNOPSIS' and the chapter's body
#       must render reasonably as plain text, because it is printed to stdout
#       when  `-h`, `--help` is specified:
#         Use 4-space indentation without markup for both the syntax line and the
#         block of brief option descriptions; represent option-arguments and operands
#         in angle brackets; e.g., '<foo>'
#     - All other headings should be level-2 headings in ALL-CAPS.
#   - TEXT
#      - Use NO indentation for regular chapter text; if you do, it will 
#        be indented further than list items.
#      - Use 4-space indentation, as usual, for code blocks.
#      - Markup character-styling markup translates to ROFF rendering as follows:
#         `...` and **...** render as bolded (red) text
#         _..._ and *...* render as word-individually underlined text
#   - LISTS
#      - Indent list items by 2 spaces for better plain-text viewing, but note
#        that the ROFF generated by marked-man still renders them unindented.
#      - End every list item (bullet point) itself with 2 trailing spaces too so
#        that it renders on its own line.
#      - Avoid associating more than 1 paragraph with a list item, if possible,
#        because it requires the following trick, which hampers plain-text readability:
#        Use '&nbsp;<space><space>' in lieu of an empty line.

## DESCRIPTION

`fvm` (*F*usion *V*M *M*anager) is a convenience wrapper around the `vmrun`  
CLI (https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vix-api/vix112_vmrun_command.pdf)  
that comes with VMWare Fusion, with added functionality for managing VM  
window states.

The major areas of functionality are:

* VMs can be targeted by display name substrings (regular expressions)  
  instead of having to specify their VMX file path.

* VMs in open windows can be activated or closed, their VMX files can be  
  revealed in Finder or opened for editing, and Fusion can be quit as a whole.

* A list of all registered VMs can be obtained with subcommand `ls`.

Commands that have a mandatory `<displayNameRegexOrVmxFile>` operand allow  
targeting a specific VM in the following ways:

* By case-insensitive POSIX-compliant extended regular expression that  
  unambiguously matches a VM's display name.  
  Note that this excludes use of word-boundary assertions such as `\b`.  
  It is sufficient for the expression to match only part of the VM's  
  display name, as long as that part is unique among all registered VMs.  
  If multiple VMs match, an error is reported, and all matching display names  
  are printed.  
  By contrast, the optional `<displayNameRegexFilter>` operand to the `ls`  
  merely acts a convenient filter and needn't match unambiguously. 

* If `-x` is specified, the operand must be a VM's full, literal display name.

* Alternatively, the path to a VM's *.vmx file may be specified, as is  
  required when using `vmrun` directly.

## COMMANDS

  * `library`  
  activates VMWare Fusion's Library window. If Fusion isn't running, it is  
  started first. This is the default command.

  * `activate`  
  activates the specified VM in its existing window. If it doesn't have a  
  window, the VM is started, which opens it in a window and starts or resumes  
  it.

  * `close`  
  closes the specified VM's window. The window is first activated, and what  
  happens if the VM is running or paused depends on your Fusion preferences.  
  For instance, the VM may auto-suspend before the window is closed.  
  If the VM has no open window, a message to that effect is prined to stderr,  
  and no action is taken (and the exit code is still zero).

  * `reveal`  
  reveals the specified VM's *.vmx file inside its *.vmwarevm bundle folder   
  in Finder.

  * `edit`  
  opens the specified VM's *.vmx file in the system's default text editor.

  * `ls`  
  lists all registered VMs sorted case-insensitively by display name by  
  default. If you add `-s`, VMs with open windows are shown first.  
  The default display is columnated, with a header, for human consumption.  
  To get header-less, tab-separated data for programmatic consumption instead,  
  use `-b`.  
  The fields output for each VM are:  
  Without -s: display name, guest OS identifier, VMX file path.  
  With -s:    display name, guest OS identifier, state, VMX file path. 
  The state field contains:  
    "on", if a VM is open in a window and running or paused  
    "win", if it is open in a window and suspended or shut down  
    a single space otherwise (not open in a window).  
  You may optionally specify a display-name regex to filter the list by.

  * `start`, `pause`, `unpause`, `suspend`, `reset`  
  perform the requested power command via `vmrun`. Note that these commands  
  are no-ops if the target VM is already in the requested state.

  * `stop`  
  stops the specified VM.  
  CAVEAT: The default mode is *hard*, which is the equivalent of pulling the  
  power cord, which *may corrupt the VM*.  
  To be safe, append argument `soft`, which gives the guest OS the chance  
  to shut down properly.

  * `<vmrun-cmd>`  
  represents all other commands that `vmrun` CLI supports, which cover a wide   
  array of functionality, including managing snapshots,  
  installing VMware Tools, and running commands inside a VM.  
  See examples below; for the complete list of supported commands, invoke this  
  utility with `--help-vmrun`.  
  
  * `quit`  
  quits VMware Fusion synchronously, activating it first, so that prompts, if  
  any, are visible. Depending on how many VMs are running, quitting can  
  take a while.

## OPTIONS

  * `-x`, `--exact-name`
    specifies that the `<displayNameRegexOrVmxFile>` operand contain a literal,
    full display name that must match the display name of the targeted VM  
    exactly.

  * `-t`, `--toggle-activation`  
    can be combined with `library` and `activate` to achieve an activation  
    toggle: if the specified VM or the library window is not currently   
    frontmost, it is activated (made frontmost); if it already is frontmost,  
    it is hidden.  
    Note that this option only makes sense if you launch `fvm` invisibly,  
    such as by keyboard shortcut via Alfred (https://www.alfredapp.com/).

  * `-b`, `--bare-output`  
    switches the `ls` command's output from the default, columated
    format to a header-less, tab-separated format, as described above.

  * `-s`, `--show-state`  
    makes the `ls` command include power state information for each VM,  
    with VMs that are open in a window listed first.  
    Within each group, the VMs are sorted case-sensitively by display name.  
    A "state" column is added to the output, whose values are described above.  
    Note that this option significantly increases execution time.  
    To see only running or paused VMs, you may use `fvm list` to pass  
    the `list` command through to `vmrun`, but note that they will be listed  
    by VMX file path only.

  * `<auth-opts>`  
    The authorization options to pass through to `vmrun`, for in-guest  
    operations, namely: `-gu <username>`, `-gp <password>` to specify guest  
    credentials, and, in case of an encrypted virtual machine, additionally  
    `-vp <vm-password>`.  
    Note, however, that you may omit these options, in which case you'll be  
    prompted interactively.

## STANDARD OPTIONS

All standard options must be provided as the only argument; all of them provide  
information only.

 * `-h, --help`  
   Prints the contents of the synopsis chapter to stdout for quick reference.

 * `--man`  
   Displays this manual page, which is a helpful alternative to using `man`,  
   if the manual page isn't installed.

 * `--version`  
   Prints version information.
  
 * `--home`  
   Opens this utility's home page in the system's default web browser.

## EXAMPLES

    # Show VMware Fusion's Library window.
    fvm       # short for: fvm library

    # Activate (open existing window or run) the VM whose display name
