.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBfvm\fP (\fIF\fRusion \fIV\fRM \fIM\fRanager) is a convenience wrapper around the \fBvmrun\fP
.br
CLI (https://www\.vmware\.com/support/developer/vix\-api/vix112_vmrun_command\.pdf)
.br
that comes with VMWare Fusion, with added functionality for managing VM
.br
window states\.
.P
The major areas of functionality are:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
VMs can be targeted by display name substrings (regular expressions)
.br
instead of having to specify their VMX file path\.
.IP \(bu 2
VMs in open windows can be activated or closed, their VMX files can be
.br
revealed in Finder or opened for editing, and Fusion can be quit as a whole\.
.IP \(bu 2
A list of all registered VMs can be obtained with subcommand \fBls\fP\|\.

.RE
.P
Commands that have a mandatory \fB<displayNameRegexOrVmxFile>\fP operand allow
.br
targeting a specific VM in the following ways:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
By case\-insensitive POSIX\-compliant extended regular expression that
.br
unambiguously matches a VM's display name\.
.br
Note that this excludes use of word\-boundary assertions such as \fB\\b\fP\|\.
.br
It is sufficient for the expression to match only part of the VM's
.br
display name, as long as that part is unique among all registered VMs\.
.br
If multiple VMs match, an error is reported, and all matching display names
.br
are printed\.
.br
By contrast, the optional \fB<displayNameRegexFilter>\fP operand to the \fBls\fP
.br
merely acts a convenient filter and needn't match unambiguously\. 
.IP \(bu 2
If \fB\-x\fP is specified, the operand must be a VM's full, literal display name\.
.IP \(bu 2
Alternatively, the path to a VM's *\.vmx file may be specified, as is
.br
required when using \fBvmrun\fP directly\.

.RE
.SH COMMANDS
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlibrary\fP
.br
activates VMWare Fusion's Library window\. If Fusion isn't running, it is
.br
started first\. This is the default command\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBactivate\fP
.br
activates the specified VM in its existing window\. If it doesn't have a
.br
window, the VM is started, which opens it in a window and starts or resumes
.br
it\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBclose\fP
.br
closes the specified VM's window\. The window is first activated, and what
.br
happens if the VM is running or paused depends on your Fusion preferences\.
.br
For instance, the VM may auto\-suspend before the window is closed\.
.br
If the VM has no open window, a message to that effect is prined to stderr,
.br
and no action is taken (and the exit code is still zero)\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBreveal\fP
.br
reveals the specified VM's \fI\|\.vmx file inside its \fR\|\.vmwarevm bundle folder
.br
in Finder\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBedit\fP
.br
opens the specified VM's *\.vmx file in the system's default text editor\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBls\fP
.br
lists all registered VMs sorted case\-insensitively by display name by
.br
default\. If you add \fB\-s\fP, VMs with open windows are shown first\.
.br
The default display is columnated, with a header, for human consumption\.
.br
To get header\-less, tab\-separated data for programmatic consumption instead,
.br
use \fB\-b\fP\|\.
.br
The fields output for each VM are:
.br
Without \-s: display name, guest OS identifier, VMX file path\.
.br
With \-s:    display name, guest OS identifier, state, VMX file path\. 
The state field contains:
.br
"on", if a VM is open in a window and running or paused
.br
"win", if it is open in a window and suspended or shut down
.br
a single space otherwise (not open in a window)\.
.br
You may optionally specify a display\-name regex to filter the list by\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstart\fP, \fBpause\fP, \fBunpause\fP, \fBsuspend\fP, \fBreset\fP
.br
perform the requested power command via \fBvmrun\fP\|\. Note that these commands
.br
are no\-ops if the target VM is already in the requested state\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstop\fP
.br
stops the specified VM\.
.br
CAVEAT: The default mode is \fIhard\fR, which is the equivalent of pulling the
.br
power cord, which \fImay corrupt the VM\fR\|\.
.br
To be safe, append argument \fBsoft\fP, which gives the guest OS the chance
.br
to shut down properly\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<vmrun\-cmd>\fP
.br
represents all other commands that \fBvmrun\fP CLI supports, which cover a wide
.br
array of functionality, including managing snapshots,
.br
installing VMware Tools, and running commands inside a VM\.
.br
See examples below; for the complete list of supported commands, invoke this
.br
utility with \fB\-\-help\-vmrun\fP\|\.  
.IP \(bu 2
\fBquit\fP
.br
quits VMware Fusion synchronously, activating it first, so that prompts, if
.br
any, are visible\. Depending on how many VMs are running, quitting can
.br
take a while\.

.RE
.SH OPTIONS
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-x\fP, \fB\-\-exact\-name\fP
specifies that the \fB<displayNameRegexOrVmxFile>\fP operand contain a literal,
full display name that must match the display name of the targeted VM
.br
exactly\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-toggle\-activation\fP
.br
can be combined with \fBlibrary\fP and \fBactivate\fP to achieve an activation
.br
toggle: if the specified VM or the library window is not currently
.br
frontmost, it is activated (made frontmost); if it already is frontmost,
.br
it is hidden\.
.br
Note that this option only makes sense if you launch \fBfvm\fP invisibly,
.br
such as by keyboard shortcut via Alfred (https://www\.alfredapp\.com/)\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-bare\-output\fP
.br
switches the \fBls\fP command's output from the default, columated
format to a header\-less, tab\-separated format, as described above\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-show\-state\fP
.br
makes the \fBls\fP command include power state information for each VM,
.br
with VMs that are open in a window listed first\.
.br
Within each group, the VMs are sorted case\-sensitively by display name\.
.br
A "state" column is added to the output, whose values are described above\.
.br
Note that this option significantly increases execution time\.
.br
To see only running or paused VMs, you may use \fBfvm list\fP to pass
.br
the \fBlist\fP command through to \fBvmrun\fP, but note that they will be listed
.br
by VMX file path only\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<auth\-opts>\fP
.br
The authorization options to pass through to \fBvmrun\fP, for in\-guest
.br
operations, namely: \fB\-gu <username>\fP, \fB\-gp <password>\fP to specify guest
.br
credentials, and, in case of an encrypted virtual machine, additionally
.br
\fB\-vp <vm\-password>\fP\|\.
.br
Note, however, that you may omit these options, in which case you'll be
.br
prompted interactively\.

.RE
.SH STANDARD OPTIONS
.P
All standard options must be provided as the only argument; all of them provide
.br
information only\.
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
.br
Prints the contents of the synopsis chapter to stdout for quick reference\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-man\fP
.br
Displays this manual page, which is a helpful alternative to using \fBman\fP,
.br
if the manual page isn't installed\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-version\fP
.br
Prints version information\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-home\fP
.br
Opens this utility's home page in the system's default web browser\.
